# cache-grab
Use proxy to grab and cache data.

- Step 1: Pass a public URL to an image or media.
- Step 2: Reuse that URL. You get the same thing as the public URL except now you'll be hitting a proxy instead of the original URL.

This is meant to either speed up things, or bypass limit sometimes imposed by some services.
